# Expense_Tracker

# Our team built an expense tracker meant to help a user track their expenses.

# First, user will be asked to enter a 1, 2, or 0 (for name, item, or done). 
# When you hit 1, user can enter name of person they are shopping for. 
# When you hit 2, user can enter the name of item they are buying. 
# When you hit 0, program assumes user is done & moves on. 
# NOTE: User can enter choices 1 or 2 up to two times, 0 will conclude it.

# Next, it will ask user to enter amount of funds they currently have. 
# User can enter either integer or decimal values. 
# After inputting money total, program will ask for amount of money spent. 
# Following this, program will ask user if there is another item to deduct. 
# Depending on answer, program will accept more items or continue. 

# If YES, user can enter another item to deduct from total money amount. 
# If NO, program will continue. 

# Now, the program will provide a balance warning message, if applicable, to  
# users that consequently have a low balance or halfway balance due to 
# purchase(s) made.

# Finally, the program will provide a dataframe, including Total, Minus,  
# Money left, Person, and Items bought rows with values that line up to break 
# down the user's expenses.

# All code written was original & from entire team. Therefore, no 
# bibliography applicable.
